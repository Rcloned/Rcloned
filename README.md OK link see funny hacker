Shows current WireGuard configuration and runtime information of specified <interface>. If no <interface> is specified, <interface> defaults to all. If interfaces is specified, prints a list of all WireGuard interfaces, one per line, and quits. If no options are given after the interface specification, then prints a list of all attributes in a visually pleasing way meant for the terminal. Otherwise, prints specified information grouped by newlines and tabs, meant to be used in scripts. For this script-friendly display, if all is specified, then the first field for all categories of information is the interface name. If dump is specified, then several lines are printed; the first contains in order separated by tab: private-key, public-key, listen-port, fwmark. Subsequent lines are printed for each peer and contain in order separated by tab: public-key, preshared-key, endpoint, allowed-ips, latest-handshake, transfer-rx, transfer-tx, persistent-keepalive.
